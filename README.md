This repository contains files that make the AirBnB clone project as well as the necessary test cases. The command interpreter reads input, matches to the methods creted and executes as the methods direct. To Understand what a command does we can use the help function that returns a discription of the command and how it works.
An example of this would be a 'greet' command. The command, when entered, simply greets the user. When passed in the console will read the input and if such a command exists will return a greeting. When we passs in 'help greet' the console should return a discription of the 'greet' command.
